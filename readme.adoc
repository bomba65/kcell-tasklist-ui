== How to get started

You need Docker stack of tools (`docker` + `docker-compose`) and Maven 3.3.9 and a decent Internet connection (Maven will download half of internet, the other half is downloaded by docker).

First, build demo process application:
----
$ cd kcell-demo-process-app
$ mvn package
$ cd ..
----

Initialize database container:
----
$ docker-compose up db
----

Start all the containers:
----
$ docker-compose up
----
Now you can navigate to http://localhost:8080/camunda. Also, the Postgresql database is exposed at `localhost:5432`

Stop the containers started in background:
----
$ docker-compose stop
----

Stop and clean all the container state (including db):
----
$ docker-compose down
----
