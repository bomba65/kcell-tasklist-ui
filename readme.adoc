This demo showcases the Kcell proof of concept application

== Features implemented

The following features are implemented:

* Basic process implementation
** Exclusive gateway with runtime decision
** Service task to call a remote SOAP service
* Task assignment to individuals or groups
* Tasklist UI
* Task forms
** Generated forms based on BPMN metadata extension
** Embedded html forms
** Generic forms built at runtime
* Process runtime info
* Task comments
* Mail notification on task assignment

Here is the BPMN diagram of the demo process:

== How to get started

You need Docker stack of tools (`docker` + `docker-compose`) installed on your environment and a decent Internet connection to download docker images.

==== Default application start

First, build demo process application:
----
$ ./docker-build.sh
----

Start all the containers in background:

_You can use NGINX_PORT variable to set Nginx container exposed port (if ignored 80 port is used by default)_

----
$ docker-compose up -d
----
Now you can navigate to *http://localhost/* to access the Camunda (creds are - demo/demo)

Stop the containers started in background:
----
$ docker-compose stop
----

Stop and clean all the container state (including db and network):
----
$ docker-compose down
----

==== Start app as Camunda developer

Use +docker-compose-dev-camunda.yml+ to start app and start your local Camunda instance:

----
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev-camunda.yml up -d
----

==== Start app as Assets developer

Use +docker-compose-dev-assets.yml+ to start app:

----
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev-assets.yml up -d
----

==== Start app in test environment

Use +docker-compose-test.yml+ to start app with some exposed ports:

----
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up -d
----

==== Start app with forwarded logs to Fluentd

For this you need to extend the base +docker-compose.yml+ with +docker-compose-fluentd.yml+:

----
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-fluentd.yml up -d
----

_You have to specify Fluentd address and port with variables: FLUENTD_ADDRESS (required), FLUENTD_PORT (by default is 24224)._

== Example

In this example we are going to:

- Start app in Camunda developer environment
- Set our web-server's container port to 81
- Sending our app logs to Fluentd instance with 25300 port

----
$ NGINX_PORT=81 FLUENTD_ADDRESS=192.168.0.50 FLUENTD_PORT=25300 docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev-camunda.yml -f docker-compose-fluentd.yml up -d
----
